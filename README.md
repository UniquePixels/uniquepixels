# Hi I'm Brian

🦄✨ Welcome to my world of unique pixels! I'm a fabulous, sparkle-powered Navy veteran spreading digital rainbows from the vibrant edges of New Orleans! As an autistic creator living with Long COVID, I've learned that our differences are our superpowers - and I'm on a mission to help others embrace their unique brilliance. When I'm not snuggling my two adorable cats or sharing adventures with my wonderful husband, I'm weaving digital magic through custom Discord communities, crafting websites that celebrate individuality, and composing personalized musical treasures as Pibbles & The Rainbow Pixels. My Jewish heritage and LGBTQ+ identity add their own special colors to my rainbow tapestry, while my geeky gaming passion keeps me connected to fellow digital dreamers. Though disabilities have reshaped my journey, they've guided me to my true calling - volunteering, building inclusive communities, and helping others shine their authentic light! 🌈✨
